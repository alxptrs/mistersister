      <p>Black Jade aka Dee Diggs<br>Meilgaarden<br>Special Guest</p>
      <p><b>WELCOME DANCERS – LOSE YOURSELF TO MUSIC</b></p>
      <p>Mister Sister returns for its third installment on a Friday night at Bossa Nova Civic Club. This time around, it’s just the sisters and we have a special lineup featuring our favorite femme DJs. We are pleased to bring on New York legend Dee Diggs. Dee has attracted international acclaim with her heavy house sound, playing in some of the most esteemed venues around the world, such as De School and Berghain, with regular appearances at New York’s BASEMENT and Nowadays. Dee’s vibe is quintessential to the Mister Sister ethos: for lovers and ravers. Holding it down for the Mister Sister family is resident Meilgaarden. And finally, we will be bringing on a special guest, announced later this week. This is not one to be missed.</p>
      <p> Mister Sister is first and foremost a Queer party for dancers and lovers. Show up and get ready to DANCE and SWEAT. We welcome all dancers on a therapeutic journey of connection, expression, and transcendence. Together, let’s lose ourselves to the spirit of music on the dancefloor.</p>
